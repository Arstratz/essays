==Mary Cassatt=={Q173223} was a 19th Century ==impressionist=={Q40415} artist who specialized in depicting the everyday lives of the modern woman. By finding beauty in the mundane, Cassatt is able to document what it was truly like to be a woman during this time.  


#Womanhood and Woodblock

Mary Cassatt's work focused on capturing the realities of women in the 19th century by depicting intimate moments of their lives. Cassatt was also greatly inspired by ==Japanese Woodblock prints=={Q1192525}. This piece captures both sentimates in its design. This print shows a woman washing her face at her vanity, her dress unbuttoned to reveal her bare back. This signifies a completely private moment where this woman is allowed to take care of only herself. The design of the wash basin and wardrobe dates this piece, making the 1890-91 date given to the print unsurprising to modern audiences. The retro stylings of the room, the garb of the woman, and dated wash basin all work to show the world of the average 20th century woman.

Cassatt often depicted images of women as caregivers for children. Whether the women in these images are mothers or hired childcare, these women are shown in nurturing roles. These nurturing roles largely represent the conventions of 19th century women. The left painting, ==The Child’s Bath=={Q3172226}  (1893), shows a woman bathing a child in a small wash bowl. The striped dress, detailed patterned carpet, and ceramic pitcher greatly resemble that of the previous painting Woman Bathing (ca.1890-91).  The woman holds the pudgy child on her lap, presses her cheek to the child’s cheek, wraps one hand around the child’s toweled waist, and carefully washes the child feet. This is an incredibly tender and intimate scene between a child and her mother. This image also represents a very specific period during the 19th century. The 1890’s saw a massive cholera outbreak within France, where Cassatt spent much of her life. Because of this, frequent bathing became standard, and families were encouraged to wash their own young instead of caregivers to reduce sickness1. In the right painting, ==Woman with a Sunflower=={Q20190957}  (1905), a woman in a yellow gown sits on a green chair with her nude child on her lap. The two hold a small hand mirror which reflects the little girl’s face. The two are also reflected within a larger wall mirror hanging behind them. This piece serves as commentary on the perception of women within a male dominated society. The nude, innocent child is guided by her modernly dressed mother. This image emphasizes the importance of this role during this modern era. The large sunflower pinned to the mother’s dress also symbolizes modernity as it was a symbol of the ==suffrage=={Q185387} movement2.
