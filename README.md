Mary Cassatt was a 19th Century impressionist artist who specialized in depicting the everyday lives of the modern woman. By finding beauty in the mundane, Cassatt is able to document what it was truly like to be a woman during this time.

Mary Cassatt's work focused on romanticising the realities of women in the 19th century by capturing intimate moments of their live. Cassatt was also greatly inspired by Japanese woodblock printwork. This piece captures both sentimates in its design. This print shows a woman washing her face at her vanity, her dress unbuttomed to reveal her bare back. This signifies a completely private moment where this woman is allowed to take care of only herself. The design of the wash basin and wardrobe dates this piece, making the 1890-91 date given to the print unsurprising. Nonetheless, this scene is one that most all women can still relate to today.
