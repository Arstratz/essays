Mary Cassatt's work focused on capturing the realities of women in the 19th century by depicting intimate moments of their lives. Cassatt was also greatly inspired by Japanese woodblock printwork. This piece captures both sentimates in its design. This print shows a woman washing her face at her vanity, her dress unbuttoned to reveal her bare back. This signifies a completely private moment where this woman is allowed to take care of only herself. The design of the wash basin and wardrobe dates this piece, making the 1890-91 date given to the print unsurprising to modern audiences. The retro stylings of the room, the garb of the woman, and dated wash basin all work to show the world of the average 20th century woman.
